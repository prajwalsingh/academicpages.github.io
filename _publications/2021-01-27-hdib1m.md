Handwritten document image binarization is a challenging task due to high diversity in the content, page style, and condition of the documents. While the traditional thresholding methods fail to generalize on such challenging scenarios, deep learning based methods can generalize well however, require a large training data. Current datasets for handwritten document image binarization are limited in size and fail to represent several challenging real-world scenarios. To solve this problem, we propose HDIB1M - a handwritten document image binarization dataset of 1M images. We also present a novel method used to generate this dataset. To show the effectiveness of our dataset we train a deep learning model UNetED on our dataset and evaluate its performance on other publicly available datasets. The dataset and the code will be made available to the community.
